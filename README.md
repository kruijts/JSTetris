### History of project
The first time I wrote a tetris game was in 2009 (in Java Swing). Around 2013 I came across my old code and realized how bad it was and rewrote to Javascript.
I was proud of reducing the sourcecode with at least a 1000 lines. Around 2015 I moved that old sourcecode into this Github repository and in 2016 I realized again how much better I got in the years after 2013 and decided it was time to use ES6 for this game.

### Status of the game
This game is far from ready. It just contains the basic gameplay, and I want to bring this to a next level.

### To do
- Add functionality to start game when user is ready, instead of right away when page is loaded.
- Add functionality to end game properly and give user an option to play another game.
- There is currently no sound, which is kinda boring.
- This game in it's previous version had an increasing difficulty since with every full row I increased the framerate. In the last version of this game I changed the gameloop, to enable a better way to increase the difficulty of the game.
- Show statistics about the game (how many full lines, next block, etc.)
